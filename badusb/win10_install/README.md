Ducky scripts for the Flipper to automate the GUI for installing Windows 10, 22H2

Notes about timing: The script implicitly assumes that your computer is relatively fast with an SSD/NVME drive. If the timing is wrong, most commands will accidentally turn on voice assistant. That said, take care when the account is created. If it goes too quickly, it's possible that your password could be added as a user account!

TODO:

-Need to add optional code block for when Ethernet and/or Wifi is available (currently it operates under the assumption that internet isn't available)

-Probably need to set a standard longer delay for part 2, since so many Delay 100 is needed
