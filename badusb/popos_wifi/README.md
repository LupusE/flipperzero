Demo of using PopOS 22.04 GUI to exfiltrate the passphrase of the first wifi connection present in network manager.

This is done primarily via GUI to avoid needing sudo trying to extract the data using the terminal.

Replace <YOUR WEBHOOK HERE> with your own appropriate webhook to capture the data.
  
Adjust timings as needed. This is purely a proof-of-concept.
