This is a collection of simple RAW captures of all the codes from the Health/Zenith Remote Light Switch.  You should be able to add these into a playlist or concatenate them together in a fancy way to make a simple bruteforcer.

The raw captures are separated into groups of On presses, and Off presses, for your convenience.
