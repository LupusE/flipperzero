This is a complete capture of a remote for an EIKI projector, remote model CXMA 

(This was captured with the remote's DIP switches 1 2 3 4 all in the ON position)

Flipper detects the protocol as NECext

This remote has a built-in mouse cursor. I believe I have a simple capture of it. These functions appear as "Cur_..." buttons.

All other buttons captured as-labeled
