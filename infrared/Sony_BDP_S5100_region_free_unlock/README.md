This is a remote mapping based on captures from a programmed OneForAll remote configured as based on this forum post: https://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks/sony-bdp-s5100/12108

Note - this procedure is reported to NOT work on REGION 1 (US) players.  It seems it may only work on Region 2 devices.  Also, this is ONLY for the DVD player. It will NOT let you play blu-ray discs region-free.

I have not been able to successfully test this. If someone finds that this works for their unit, file an Issue on Github and I'll update the Readme and give YOU CREDIT!
