Capture of the remote for a Sony RM PJ27 projector remote. Untested.

The remote has a four-way ID indicator switch. The currentl capture is only for ID 1.  Most of the buttons share the same address, but not all. Some samples of the pwoer button are included at the end, for reverse engineering. I will get a complete capture of this in the future.
