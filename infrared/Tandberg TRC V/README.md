A mostly-comlpete capture of a Tandberg TRC V "iTV" remote. I was able to capture everything except for the Home button, which wouldn't register on the Flipper at all. Also, there appears to be a random IR emission periodically that Flipper reads 65 samples from.  I've saved that as "Unknown_65" on the remote.

Flipper was not able to decode anything, so they're all RAW captures.

Untested.
