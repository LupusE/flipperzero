Complete capture of a Marantz RC2100DR.  I no longer have access to the original equipment this went to (I think it was a CD changer/recorder).  This remote appears to be a mix of RC5, RC5X, and RAW.  It also has two profiles - CD and CDR. Since I'm not sure exactly which things change with the profile, I've simply made two captures.  CD does not include the record functions, as they don't do anything when the remote is set to that mode.
