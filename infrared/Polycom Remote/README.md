This is a complete capture, to the best of my abilities, of a VX series Polycom remote.  
I do not currently have the means to test this, as the equipment is obsolete.

Note that the remote has two feet that act as buttons when the remote is placed down on a surface.

This acts as an idle/active status for the Polycom unit, iirc.

There is a signal that is sent when these buttons are pressed. This is "Remote_down_idle"

A brief signal is sent (and I believe is sent periodically) immediately after the feet buttons are released (when the remote is picked up).
This is "Remote_up"

Untested
