This is a complete capture of a PTZ Optics remote.

All four camera profiles have been captured.

For those using firmware that allows them to use the IR Remote app (Apps/Tools/IR Remote), I've included some convenient remote layouts in the 'remote' directory.

To use them, first place the files Ptz_cam1.ir Ptz_cam2.ir Ptz_cam3.ir Ptz_cam4.ir files on your Flipper into the folder:
SD Card/infrared/ptzoptics

Next, place cam1.txt cam2.txt cam3.txt and cam4.txt on your Flipper into the folder:
SD Card/infrared/remote

Controls included are:
Up
Down
Left 
Right
Reset
Power
