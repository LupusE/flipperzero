Complete capture of a mysterious "Contemporary Research" remote.  I think this went to a really old, non-digital TV tuner.  All the samples are RAW and of varying number of samples, so I have little confidence this will work. But it's the best I could do.

Partially-tested on a 232-STS Tuner 7/3/2023. Some of the buttons did not respond as expected, so I will be re-doing the capture and trying it again.
