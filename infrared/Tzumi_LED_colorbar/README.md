Complete capture of the remote that comes with the Tzumi LED colorbar.  

I had a hard time naming the colors from the remote. I'm sorry.

Per the manual, Brightness Up/Down will control the brightness when the device is set to a specific color. When the device is set to Flash, Strobe, Fade, Smooth, the Brightness Up/Down will control the speed of those functions.  When adjusting the brightness or the speed, the device will flash white to indicate it can no longer adjust in that direction further (i.e. when pressing bright and the device is as bright as it can go, it will flash white when you continue to press bright up)

Tested fully.

Also works on:
