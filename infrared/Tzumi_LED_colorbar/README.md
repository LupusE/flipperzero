Complete capture of the remote that comes with the Tzumi LED colorbar.  

I had a hard time naming the colors from the remote. I'm sorry.

Per the manual, Brightness Up/Down will control the brightness when the device is set to a specific color. When the device is set to Flash, Strobe, Fade, Smooth, the Brightness Up/Down will control the speed of those functions.

Tested fully.
