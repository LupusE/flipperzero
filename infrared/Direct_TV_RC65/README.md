A capture of a Direct TV RC65 remote.

According to the manual (https://www.teacremotes.com/Remotes/Directv_RC65_Manual.pdf), the DirectTV receiver has a 5-digit code that requires pairing with the remote by sliding the mode switch to DirectTV and then pressing Mute and Select until green light under DirectTV flashes twice.   Then enter the code using the number pad. If correct, the green light will flash twice.  At this point, you should be able to turn off the DirectTV receiver

I have not located the code this remote is programmed for, so for now this capture is "as-is."

This will require some further investigation.

I have omitted any button that is programmed for an actual TV, and not for the DirectTV receiver itself.

Untested.
