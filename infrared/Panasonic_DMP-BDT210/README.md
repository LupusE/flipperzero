This is a re-created remote for a Panasonic DMP-BDT210, based very heavily on the DMP-BD75.ir file by sealldeveloper, here:
https://github.com/logickworkshop/Flipper-IRDB/blob/acec83b9089daf4b71ec873240ead74c5ce56af5/Blu-Ray/Panasonic/Panasonic_DMP_BD75.ir

Thank you, sealldeveloper

(I also looked to the irplus captures for this device and not only did I not find any new features, but the layout of all of the irplus remotes for this series is misaligned)

There aren't any major differences with this remote file from sealldeveloper's.   This unit supports 3D, but I do not currently have any way to test this. The remote for this unit has a specific 3D button, so I don't know if this works.  

I've found a button that switches the resolution to 480p, so I included that. I think I previously found a 1080 button in testing, but I'm no longer able to replicate this.  So further research is needed.

I've also included the Skype button, although this function has been discontinued.
