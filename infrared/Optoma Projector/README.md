Capture of an Optoma Projector remote. Unable to determine exact model of projector. Unable to test due to the projectopr being non-functional.

I had difficulty getting reads of the source buttons, so be aware.

I also found some hidden buttons when I opened the remote. I have read and labeled those as unknown_1 - 7, and they are in order from top-to-bottom, left-to-right on the remote.
