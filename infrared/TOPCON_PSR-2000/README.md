Capture of a TOPCON PSR-2000 (MSR-2001) remote for a vision test machine.  

Captures are all RAW.  To ensure a complete RAW capture was saved, Debux RX mode was used to establish how many samples each button sends out on average, and only saved Reads when the expected number was captured.

Untested.
